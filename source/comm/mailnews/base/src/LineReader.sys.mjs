/**
 * For certain requests, mail servers return a multi-line response that are
 * handled by this class. The definitions of multi-line responses can be found
 * for NNTP at
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3977#section-3.1.1
 * and for POP3 at
 * https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1939#section-3
 *
 *
 * This class deals with multi-line responses by:
 * - Receiving each response segment and appending them all together.
 * - Detecting the end of the response by seeing "\r\n.\r\n" in the last segment
 * - Breaking up a response into lines
 * - Removing a possible stuffed dot (.. at the beginning of a line)
 * - Passing each line to a processing function, lineCallback.
 * - Calling a finalization function, doneCallback, when all lines are processed
 */
